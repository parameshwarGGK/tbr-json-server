While Accenture will continue to generate a fair amount of business from Oracle cloud migration and Salesforce implementation services, SAP Business Suite 4 HANA (S/4HANA) migration will likely be one of the single-largest opportunities for Accenture over the next few years, given its large legacy client install base and SAP&rsquo;s deadline for ending support of SAP R3, which will compel clients to move to S/4HANA by 2025.
